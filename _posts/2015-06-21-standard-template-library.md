The Standard Template Library offers a lot of ready-to-use implementations of the most common data structures and algorithms. It contains implementations of basically all containers you will ever need, as well as the Algorithms library for manipulating containers.

A small selection of algorithms:

* __[find](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/find)__: Finds and element in a range.
* __[sort](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort)__: Sorts a range of elements.
* __[transform](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/transform)__: Applies a function to a range of elements
* __[binary_search](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/binary_search)__: Performs a binary search on a sorted range.

Have a look at the [C++ reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/) for a list of all available containers and algorithms.
